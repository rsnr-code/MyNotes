[MyNotes](https://mynoteslive.herokuapp.com/) is a full-stack application built using EJS to generate HTML markup, Nodejs as the backend JavaScript runtime environment, Express.js as the backend framework, and MongoDB as the database. This application allows users to create accounts (via passport-local authentication), write notes with either private or public status, and display them to other users.
